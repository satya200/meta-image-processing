Mostly We called this as a Digital Image Processing(DIP)

What is DIP?
-------------
DIP is manipulation of digital images through digital computer.DIP focus on devloping a computer system that is able to perform processing an image. The input of that system is digital image and system process the image using effcient algorithm and give a output image. The best exmple is adobe photoshop.

Block Diagram:

	Image ----caputerd by camera---> Camera ---sen to---> DIP system ----out put----> Processed Image

What is Image?
---------------
Image is nothing but a 2-D Array.It is defind in mathematical f(x,y) where x and y is the 2 cordinates as horizental and vertical. And one image is combination of pixcel.

Different Type Of Image Processing:
-----------------------------------
	1> Analog Image Processing
		This Image processing is done by Electrical Signal. Ex: TV Broadcast
	2> Digital Image Processing
		This Image Processing is deals with developing digital system that performs Operation on digital Camera.

Relation between Signal and Digital Image:
-------------------------------------------
Signal:
-------
In physical world any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as signal. A signal can be a 1-D and 2-D signal. Example of 1-D Signal is voice and 2-D Signal is Image.

How Digital Image is formed:
-----------------------------
Since caputering image in camera is a physical process. The sunlight use as a source of energy. A sensor array is used to acquisition of the image. So when sunlight falls on the object the amount of light reflected from the object which is sensed by the sensors and continues voltage signal is generated by amount of sensed data.
In order to create digital image We need to convert this data in digital form for this we will use sampling or quantization which will provide 2-D array or matrix of numbers which are nothing but digital image.

Analog Signal:
---------------
A signal could be analog quantity that means it is defind with respect to time. It is a continues signal. It is very difficult to analyse as they are carries more data. To store these need more memory. It is more accurate becz it have large samples of values. Analog signal denotes sine waves.[Refer pic-1.0 in notebook]

Example: Human voice
---------------------
Whne we sppek that voice travel through air as a pressure waves and thus it belogns to mathematical function having independent variable of space and time and value corresepending to air pressure.

Digital Signal:
----------------
As compared to analog signal this signal is very easy to analyse becz it is dis continues signal. It is approximatesly Analog signal. In this signal only 2 values are used 0 or 1. Digital Signals are less accurate than analog signal becz they are descrete in nature means descreate samples are collected on specific time interval from analog signal.

Example: Square waves [Refer pic-1.1 in motebook]

Conversion Of Analog to Digital Signal
---------------------------------------
	There are 2 methodes mostly we are following in DIP.
	1> Sampling
	2> Quantization
1> Sampling:
------------
	It will take samples from x-axis.
2> Quantization:
-----------------
	It will take quantity from y-axis

Different Type of Images are present:
-------------------------------------
1> Orginal Image		4> Sharp Image
2> Zoomed Image			5> Edges
3> Blurr Image

Continues Systems Called Analog Signal. [pic 2.0]
Discrete System Called Digital Signal.	[pic 2.1]

Human eye can only see visible proton. But Camera can able to see everythins libe X-ray(widely use in medical), Gama Ray(Use in nuclear medicine).

Application Of DIP:
--------------------


    Image sharpening and restoration

    Medical field

    Remote sensing

    Transmission and encoding

    Machine/Robot vision

    Color processing

    Pattern recognition

    Video processing

    Microscopic Imaging

    Others

Color Processing:
------------------
Color processing means process of colored images and different color spaces that are used. For example RGB color, YCbCr, HSV. It also involves studying transmission, stprage and encoding of these color images.

Video Processing:
------------------
A video is nothing but just very fast movement of pictures. The quality of video depends on number of frames/picture per second and quality of each frame is being used. Video processing involves noise reduction, detail enhancment, motion detection, frame rate conversion, asept ratio conversion, color space conversion etc.

Dimension:
-----------
This is define the minimum number of pointes required to point a position any particular object within a space. The object which are present in earth having 3 measure things to idenify location
	1> Longitude
	2> Latitude
	3> Altitude
Above fast 2 define the location and thired one is define the height level from sea level.

Different Dimension Signal:
----------------------------
1> 1-D Signal:
---------------
	Mathemetical Representation: f(x) waveform => Where x is independent variable. Please refer note book[].

2> 2-D Signal:
---------------
	Mathemetical Representation: f(x,y) image => Where x & y is independent variable. Please refer note book[].

3> 3-D Signal:
---------------
	Mathemetical Representation: f(x,y,z) Animated charecter => Where x & y & z is independent variable. Please refer note book[]. Here 3rd dimension will give deapth.

4> 4-D Signal:
---------------
	Mathemetical Representation: f(x,y,z,t) Animated movie => Where x, y, z,t is independent variable. Please refer note book[]. Here 4th dimension represent time. Best example is 3d animated movie playes.

How Human Eye works?
---------------------
Refer[] in note book

When light fall on particular object it reflected back after stricking that object abd this reflection pass through the lense of eye from a particular angle, the image created in ratina which one is presnt back side of wall. The Image that is formed is inverted. This inverted image identify by brain and get re-invert.

Image formation of analog camera:
----------------------------------
Refer[] in note book

Example: Our old camera or roll/negative based camera
In this camera the image formation is due to some chemical reaction that takes place on the strip(called negative or roll) that is use for image formation.
A 35mm strip is used and it is coated with silver halid(a chemical substance). Here light is nothing but a small particle called photon particle. When this photon particle pass through the camera it hits with strip and some chemical reaction occure with silver halid present on striped and resultant we will get negative of image.

Basic Block Diagram:
---------------------
Photon(light) + Silver Halid(present in stripe) + Some chemical reaction with silver halid + Image Negative

Image formation of Digital camera:
-----------------------------------
Refer[] in note book

In this camera CCD( Charge Couple Device ) array is used for capture Image. It is kind of image sensor. It will sense the image and produce the electrical signal.
CCD is kind of shape of array in a rectangular grid. It is likes matrix in which each sensor sense the intensity of photon(light). Refer pic[] in note book

Like analog camera in digital also after light fall on object it reflected and enter to camera. CCD having multiple analog sensor it will sense all the photones of light strike on the chip. So CCD having limited no of sensor that means it can save limites images. To measure no of photones stricking external CMOS sensor is attached with CCD.

Introduction to Pixcell:
-------------------------
The nubmer of sensores = no of pixels. It means each sensor only have one and only one value.

Storing Image:
---------------
The charges store in CCD are converted to voltage one pixcel at a time. using additinal circuit this voltage converted into digital information and stored. The quality of picture is depends on type and quality of CCD array that has been used.

Aperture:
----------
It is a small opening which allow light to pass inside camera. This is having some small no of hexagonal shape is present to adjust light. If we open more more light will pass.
The effect of aperture directly correspond to broghtness and darkness of image. If apertue opening is wide it will allow more light to pass to camera and result photo lookes more brighter if it open less wide less light will pass and photo lookes darker.

Size of aperture is inversly propertional to opening of aperture. Larger apertre size small f value(where f denoted as size of aperture) and vice versa.

Shutter:
---------
After Aperture shutter will come. Shutter is like a black caution and ccd sensor is present behind it. When shutter is open light falls on image sensor and image is formed.
Effect:
-------
	Ig shutter allow light to pass very longer the image will be brighter. In same case if shutter will close early image became darker.
	Two types of shutter is present
		1> Shutter Speed
		2> Shutter Time
	1> Shutter Speed:
	-------------------
		Number of time Shutter open and close.
	2> Shutter Time:
	------------------
		How much time shutter open means (shutter open - shtter close)

Relation:
----------
Shutter spped and shutter time is inversly propertional with each other.

ISO:
----
ISO facter measures the no. It denotes sensitivity of light to camera. If the IOSO increase in image noise also increase. So now days max comapny's are working with noise reduction if ISO set to high.

Pixel:
-------
Earch Pixel correspond to any one value. In 8-bit grey scale image the value will be between 0-255. The value of pixel at any point correspond to intensity of light photons striking at that point.

Pixcel Relation with CCD Array:
---------------------------------
THE SMALLEST ELEMENT IN CCD ARRAY CALLED PIXEL.
Total no of pixel = Now of Row * No Of Col

Perspective Transfprmation:
----------------------------
When human eye see near things lookes bigger than far things. i.e. called Perspective. The perspective tranformation deals with convertion of 3d image to 2d image.

There are total 5 frames are present and flow will be according to below order.
a> Object => This frame is used to modeling object. For example checking that perticular object in proper place or not. This is 3d coordinate.

b> World => This co-ordinate frame is used to co-relating object in 3d world.

c> Camera co-ordinate => This co-ordinate put the object in respect to camera object.

d> Image Co-ordinate => This will describe how 3d is mapped to 2d co-ordinate.

e> Pixel Co-ordinate => This is 2d co-ordinate. Here each pixel have value.

WHAT IS FOCAL LENGTH?
----------------------
ANS:-> Focal length of the lense is the distancebetween the lense and image sensor when subject is in focus normaly it is 28 to 100mm.

Please check note book [pic ]

Bits Per Pixel:
-----------------
The famos grey scale image is 8bit and the bpp=2 ^ 8 = 256 and 0 to 255. 0 is black and 255 is white
So always 0 is black and white is (2)^bpp - 1.

Image Storage:
---------------
Image storage totaly depend upon three things
	1> Num of Rows
	2> Num Of Colm
	3> Num of bits per pixel
Total Size = Rows * Colms * BPP
