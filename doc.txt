////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Mostly We called this as a Digital Image Processing(DIP)

What is DIP?
-------------
DIP is manipulation of digital images through digital computer.DIP focus on devloping a computer system that is able to perform processing an image. The input of that system is digital image and system process the image using effcient algorithm and give a output image. The best exmple is adobe photoshop.

	Image ----caputerd by camera---> Camera ---sen to---> DIP system ----out put----> Processed Image

What is Image?
---------------
Image is nothing but a 2-D Array.It is defind in mathematical f(x,y) where x and y is the 2 cordinates as horizental and vertical. And one image is combination of pixcel.

Different Type Of Image Processing:
-----------------------------------
	1> Analog Image Processing
		This Image processing is done by Electrical Signal. Ex: TV Broadcast
	2> Digital Image Processing
		This Image Processing is deals with developing digital system that performs Operation on digital Camera.

Relation between Signal and Digital Image:
-------------------------------------------
Signal:
-------
In physical world any quantity measurable through time over space or any higher dimension can be taken as signal. A signal can be a 1-D and 2-D signal. Example of 1-D Signal is voice and 2-D Signal is Image.

How Digital Image is formed:
-----------------------------
Since caputering image in camera is a physical process. The sunlight use as a source of energy. A sensor array is used to acquisition of the image. So when sunlight falls on the object the amount of light reflected from the object which is sensed by the sensors and continues voltage signal is generated by amount of sensed data.
In order to create digital image We need to convert this data in digital form for this we will use sampling or quantization which will provide 2-D array or matrix of numbers which are nothing but digital image.

Analog Signal:
---------------
A signal could be analog quantity that means it is defind with respect to time. It is a continues signal. It is very difficult to analyse as they are carries more data. To store these need more memory. It is more accurate becz it have large samples of values. Analog signal denotes sine waves.[Refer pic-1.0 in notebook]

Example: Human voice
---------------------
Whne we sppek that voice travel through air as a pressure waves and thus it belogns to mathematical function having independent variable of space and time and value corresepending to air pressure.

Digital Signal:
----------------
As compared to analog signal this signal is very easy to analyse becz it is dis continues signal. It is approximatesly Analog signal. In this signal only 2 values are used 0 or 1. Digital Signals are less accurate than analog signal becz they are descrete in nature means descreate samples are collected on specific time interval from analog signal.

Example: Square waves [Refer pic-1.1 in motebook]

Conversion Of Analog to Digital Signal
---------------------------------------
	There are 2 methodes mostly we are following in DIP.
	1> Sampling
	2> Quantization
1> Sampling:
------------
	It will take samples from x-axis.
2> Quantization:
-----------------
	It will take quantity from y-axis
